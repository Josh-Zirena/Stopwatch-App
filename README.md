# Stopwatch-App
This console app was created to show why OOP concepts such as abstraction and encapsulation are important. In this usecase, we set all of our Stopwatch class fields to private so that it becomes impossible for anyone using the class to set our project into an unexpected state. We also disallow the setting of _startTime or _endTime in any way other than the intended manner.
